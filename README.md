# Explaining the use of stylesheet.css

`stylesheet.css` is a file used to stylize a website. The exact details of the stylesheet may be changed at any time, but the specific links between elements and CSS rules are used as placeholders.

For newer developers, this file can be a starting point for understanding the capabilities of CSS files as whole.

# Legal notices

As of 12/22/2024, the file only has one version, which is a rudamentary set of stylizing rules as a building block for website development. Changes may be made in the future, which I (Nichoals S. Blits) will make note of as they happen.
